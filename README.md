This is an example Lazarus project showing the very basic use of MAAplot.

The basic example is meant to show how to create a plot, aplotrect, two axes
and s simple 2D series to add data.

The more complete example shows most of the plot possibilities.
Once you see a dataplot, the right mouse button is your friend
(also the lest button or the wheel combined with the CTRL or SHIFT key).

MAAplot is a set of classes for scientific data plotting
and is needed to compile the examples.
