1. PlotClass
The folder PlotClass contains 16 units.
Place this folder somewhere and make it available to your 
Lazarus/fpc project.
Example: 
- You have your project located in /home/me/myLazarusProject
- Put the PlotClass in /home/me/myLazarusProject/PlotClass
- Add /home/me/myLazarusProject/PlotClass to your compiler path in Lazarus project settings

You are now ready to use the plot by including uPlotClass in your uses clause.
You might need more than the base unit, so the complete story is to add:
  uPlotClass, uPlotRect, uPlotAxis, uPlotSeries, uPlotStyles;
  
Follow the instructions in the unit uPlotClass, read the documentation or
check the examples provided:
- "MAAplot_example_basic" for a very basic example and first starting point
- "MAAplot_example" for a more complete overview of what is possible with the plot

No further installation is required.

2. Examples
Simply compile with Lazarus.
Lazarus 1.02 to 1.2.6 should work.
Works with win32, Linux with qt4 and gtk2
